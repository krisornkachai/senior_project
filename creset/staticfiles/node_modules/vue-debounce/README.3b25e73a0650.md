A simple to use directive for debounce solutions

It attaches itself to an event for actions

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

## Features

- Dynamic debouncing for input based requests
- Easy to use, just place it into your vue instance and attach it to your inputs/components
- Self regulating no need to worry about it, set it and forget it
- Multiple time formats supported (miliseconds and seconds)
- Enter key support automatically fire the desired function when the user hits the enter key in the desired input (Can also be disabled)

## Modifiers

- `lock` : Used to lock the debounce and prevent the enter key from triggering the function when pressed
  - Example: `v-debounce:400ms.lock="cb"`
- `unlock` : Used to unlock the enter key on a debounced input, useful if you want to use the `lock` option and only want a few debounced inputs unlocked

## Options

- `lock` : `Boolean` : Default: `false` - This works the same way as the modifier does, however using the option will lock _ALL_ of the debounced inputs within that vue instance, where as using the modifer only locks the one it's attached to
- `listenTo` : `String` : Default: `onkeyup` - Allows you to set a custom event attached to an element like `oninput` for example
  - It's important to not that these are GLobal Event Handlers directly attached to the HTML element: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers

## Usage

First make sure we tell vue to use it

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import vueDebounce from 'vue-debounce'

Vue.use(vueDebounce)

// Or if you want to pass in the lock option
Vue.use(vueDebounce, {
  lock: true
})

// Setting a different event to listen to
Vue.use(vueDebounce, {
  listenTo: 'oninput'
})
```

Then attach a time:format to the directive, and set the value to the function you want to call and attach it to your input element

Example:

```vue
<input v-debounce:300ms="myFunc" type="text" />
```

If no wait timer is passed in, then the directive will default to 300ms.

You can pass the time in multiple formats:

```vue
<!-- If no time format is attached ms is used -->
<input v-debounce:300="myFunc" type="text" />

<!-- Seconds format is supported -->
<input v-debounce:1s="myFunc" type="text" />

<!-- Using Modifiers locking the input so the enter key isn't registered -->
<input v-debounce:1s.lock="myFunc" type="text" />

<!-- Using Modifiers unlocking the input so the enter key is registered -->
<!-- If you've set lock to true as an option when adding this module -->
<input v-debounce:1s.unlock="myFunc" type="text" />
```

The value of the input is passed along to your function

A full example:

```vue
<template>
  <input v-debounce:400ms="myFn" type="text" />
</template>
<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    myFn(val) {
      console.log(val) // => The value of the input
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
